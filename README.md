- **Segments**: Manage different field tasks such as soil mixing, water management, and climate monitoring.

### Detailed Information
- **Field Coordinates**: View the location of your fields on a map.
- **Climate Factors**: Monitor temperature, humidity, and weather conditions to ensure optimal seed growth.

### Task Management
- **Soil Mixing**: Track and manage tasks related to soil preparation and mixing.
- **Water Management**: Monitor water flow and manage irrigation tasks.
- **Climate Monitoring**: Keep track of climate-related tasks and ensure the right conditions for your crops.

## Setup

### Set Up Your Field Details
1. **Seed Type**: Select the type of seed you are planting.
2. **Area Segment**: Define the area segments of your field.
3. **Water Management**: Set up your irrigation preferences.
4. **Soil Mixing**: Configure soil preparation tasks.

### Statistics and Insights
- **Seeds per Area**: Monitor the number of seeds planted per area segment.
- **Water Management**: Track water usage and efficiency.
